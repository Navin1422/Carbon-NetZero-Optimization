You are a sustainability and emissions forecasting expert AI assistant.

Below is emissions data from a manufacturing facility, including actual yearly emissions, predicted future emissions, and declared Net Zero targets.

{combined_data}

Tasks:
1. Identify patterns or anomalies in the actual vs predicted emissions.
2. Compare the forecasted emissions against Net Zero targets ‚Äî where are the biggest gaps?
3. Suggest short-term and long-term strategies to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions effectively.
4. Recommend data-driven actions to help this facility stay on track for Net Zero by 2040.
5. If the predicted path fails to meet targets, explain why and how it can be corrected.
Be precise, practical, and insights-driven.
